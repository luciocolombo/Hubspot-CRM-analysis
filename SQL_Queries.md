# SQL Queries and Insights â€” HubSpot CRM Dataset

We focus on pure information querying here. Visualization and interpretation will happen in the dashboard.

## 1. Volume: How many deals are created per period and how does volume trend?

**Deals created per month**

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', deal_create_date) AS month_created,
  COUNT(*) AS n_deals
FROM `hubspot-crm-analysis.export.users`
GROUP BY month_created
ORDER BY month_created;
```

| month_created | n_deals |
| ------------- | ------: |
| 2024-01       |       1 |
| 2024-02       |       4 |
| 2024-03       |       2 |

**Cumulative deals created by month**

```sql
WITH monthly AS (
  SELECT
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', deal_create_date) AS month_created,
    COUNT(*) AS n_deals
  FROM `hubspot-crm-analysis.export.users`
  GROUP BY month_created
)
SELECT
  month_created,
  n_deals,
  SUM(n_deals) OVER (ORDER BY month_created) AS cumulated
FROM monthly
ORDER BY month_created;
```

| month_created | n_deals | cumulated |
| ------------- | ------: | --------: |
| 2024-01       |       1 |         1 |
