# üß© HubSpot CRM Data Analysis (SQL + Dashboard)

üìä **Objective**  
Analyze CRM data exported from HubSpot to uncover insights about deal volume, lead sources, pipelines, response times, and customer behavior.  
This project simulates a **marketing and sales operations analyst** workflow ‚Äî transforming flat CRM exports into actionable intelligence.

All SQL exploration and metrics are documented in [`SQL_Queries.md`](SQL_Queries.md).<br>

### üí° Context

HubSpot‚Äôs free tier offered very limited dashboard and reporting functionality, which heavily restricted analytical depth and customization.  
To overcome these limitations, I migrated the dataset to **BigQuery** for SQL-based exploration and connected it to **Tableau** for interactive visualization and trend analysis.

## üì¶ Dataset

**Source:** HubSpot CRM export (`hubspot-crm-analysis.export.users`)  
**Rows:** ~300  
**Fields:**  
`deal_create_date`, `deal_stage`, `deal_pipeline`, `deal_amount_usd`,  
`contact_lead_source`, `contact_owner_name`, `contact_response_time_days`,  
`company_name`, `company_domain`

The dataset represents a sample CRM deal table combining marketing, sales, and company attributes.
